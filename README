# entropy based credential scanning

## usage

First let's extract all the strings from a collection of source code:

    find ~/some/go/source/code -name "*.go" \
      -exec python tokens.py {} \; | sort | uniq > strings.txt

Feel free to alter the `find` to make sure it scans the source code you want.

Next let's try and detect passwords in these strings:

    python entropy.py strings.txt

or

    cat strings.txt | python entropy.py

This tool outputs the estimated entropy, the estimated entropy per character,
and the string.

## caveats

This works really well on deployment manifests but has only average performance
when looking at source code. Perhaps a more context aware scanning would
perform better here.
