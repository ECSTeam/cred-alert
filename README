## set up

You'll need to install `gosub` in order to manage the submodules of this
project. It can be installed by running the following command (try to install
this in an outer $GOPATH so that you do not clutter up this directory with the
tooling):

    $ go get github.com/vito/gosub

In order to have your $GOPATH and $PATH set up properly when you enter this
directory you should install `direnv`. On macOS you can install this by running
this command and following the instructions to set up your shell:

    $ brew install direnv

The tests can be run using the `ginkgo` command line tool. This can be
installed with:

    $ go install github.com/onsi/ginkgo/ginkgo


## workflow

You can `go get` and edit the files like normal in this repository. If any
dependencies have changed them make sure to run `scripts/sync-submodules` in
order to make sure that the submodules are updated correctly.

You can generate a pretty commit message by running `scripts/commit-with-log`.
