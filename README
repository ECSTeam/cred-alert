## usage

You'll need to install `gosub` in order to manage the submodules of this
project. It can be installed by running the following command (try to install
this in an outer $GOPATH so that you do not clutter up this directory with the
tooling):

    $ go get github.com/vito/gosub


In order to have your $GOPATH and $PATH set up properly when you enter this
directory you should install `direnv`. On macOS you can install this by running
this command and following the instructions to set up your shell:

    $ brew install direnv


The tests can be run using the `ginkgo` command line tool. This can be
installed with:

    $ go install github.com/onsi/ginkgo/ginkgo
